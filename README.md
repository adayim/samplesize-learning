## README

This repository provides the R code for *Sample size determination via learning-type curves*. The details of the method is described [here]().

1. `gp-functions.R`:     Function contains Gaussian Process  model fitting and prediction code.
2. `nls-functions.R`:    Function contains Nonlinear Least Squares model fitting and prediction code.
3. `gp-mod.txt`:         Jags code for Gaussian Process, called by `gp-functions.R`.
4. `gp-mod-prior.txt`:   Jags code for Gaussian Process with external data as prior, called by `gp-functions.R`.
